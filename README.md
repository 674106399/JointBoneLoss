# JointBoneLoss
This is an implementation of Joint Bone Loss from [Weakly-Supervised Mesh-Convolutional Hand Reconstruction in the Wild]([[2004.01946\] Weakly-Supervised Mesh-Convolutional Hand Reconstruction in the Wild (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01946)). （CVPR2020 Oral）

I experiment it on my own pose estimation tasks(both of heatmap-based and regression-based tasks) and achieve good performance. 

Here's a training log of my experiment about wi/wo boneloss on heatmap-based pose estimation model.

I'd like to share it with you guys, enjoy~
